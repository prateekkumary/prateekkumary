My journey in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence began with a simple curiosity — how can data truly make systems smarter and decision-making faster?

That curiosity soon evolved into a strong passion for uncovering patterns, building intelligent models, and turning raw data into meaningful action. With a background in Computer Science Engineering and ongoing advanced learning in Data Science and AI at IIT Guwahati, I’ve built a foundation rooted in both analytical thinking and hands-on experimentation.

I enjoy exploring the full data pipeline — from collecting and cleaning data to developing machine learning models, LLM-based agents, and real-time analytical dashboards. For me, every dataset is a story waiting to be told, and every model is a step toward making technology more human-aware.

What drives me most is the impact: using AI to solve complex, real-world problems across domains like predictive analytics, automation, and intelligent systems. I’m passionate about blending creativity with technical precision — ensuring every project I work on is both insightful and purposeful.
